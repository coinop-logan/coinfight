# Coinfight

Build an army out of crypto (xDai), fight other armies, pick up the pieces, and get out with more crypto (xDai)! Unless you blunder and lose your army. Then all that money's gone!

The game is still in early alpha, but here are some basic media pieces:

* [Introducing Coinfight](https://medium.com/@coinop.logan/introducing-coinfight-db55c3f918ed) - 10 min read
* [v0.1.6 showcase/demo](https://youtu.be/QRzH7jZX7B4) - 4 min video

I'm making frequent updates, and hope to run a public round of the game sometine in 2022.

# Client Build Instructions

## Mac and Linux

If using Mac, make sure `brew` is installed.

In the root directory of the project, run `./configure` to install a couple dependecies, then run `make client`. This should populate `bin/` with the `client` binary and a few resources.

## Windows

# Coinfight

Build an army out of crypto (xDai), fight other armies, pick up the pieces, and get out with more crypto (xDai)! Unless you blunder and lose your army. Then all that money's gone!

The game is still in early alpha, but here are some basic media pieces:

* [v0.1.6 showcase/demo](https://youtu.be/QRzH7jZX7B4) - 4 min video

~~I'm making frequent updates, and hope to run a public round of the game sometine in 2022.~~ Ran out of money, gotta refill the tank! Hope to return to this soon.

# Client Build Instructions

## Mac and Linux

If using Mac, make sure `brew` is installed.

In the root directory of the project, run `./configure` to install a couple dependecies, then run `make client`.

This should populate `bin/` with the `client` and `coinfight_local` binaries and a few resources. Running `./coinfight_local` is a good way to test that the game runs smoothly without connecting to a server.

## Windows

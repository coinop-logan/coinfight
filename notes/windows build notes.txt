download/install CodeBlocks
	get the installer WITH MinGW
	install directly to C:/CodeBlocks

Add CodeBlocks/MinGW/bin AND CodeBlocks/MinGW/x86../bin to PATH

download SFML 2.5 (already built)
    when faced with the choices at https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/, make sure you download the version matched for your version of MinGW
download boost
build boost
	odd - might not be necessary. Note that the Coinfight codeblocks project doesn't link to any boost stuff...

	After downloading/unzipping,
	in root folder:
		./bootstrap.bat gcc
		./b2 toolset=gcc --with-system --with-thread
	

The CodeBlocks project looks for resulting include and lib files in C:\libs and C:\include ; move files from the above steps here

git clone the project (you'll need to setup ssh key)
Open up the Codeblocks project file in the repo and compile
you may need to change the cpp compile version setting - not sure if that's saved in the project
